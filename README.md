### read.me

0. MATLAB required
1. download and place the files in **one file**
2. run 'set_up.mat'
3. run 'Heat_transfer_3Dground_simulation.mat'
4. run 'Heat_transfer_3Dground_plotter.mat'

> 'room_input(2)' contains the informations of the room we are modeling
> 'TMY3' contains the weather data of a whole year (from 1/1 to 12/31)
